It’s a universal realization, and at the same time deeply personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And upon taking a moment to reflect, I manage to convince myself it’s true. &lt;em&gt;A year has passed me by.&lt;/em&gt; I know this not because people tell me so, not by the cold logic of my phone’s  lock-screen. I know this by attempting to remember it all, and realizing how much happened. One year, nine months, 270 days, 23728014.6155408 +/- 100000 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t take it in all at once. I’m left with a series of impressions. The beginning in a chaotic jumble with Rush and advanced standing exams and meeting people and calling Joe Bob and Bob Joe spelling Sameer Samir. How I learned names and building numbers and that building 7 and 8 are on opposite sides of campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end remains lucid and just below the surface. Finals, a battle between me and the page that after weeks of study leave me unsure of the winner, and here at the end not caring in the slightest. I’m done, and that’s all that matters. Packing, and my confrontation with a fact as inexorable as Newton’s fourth law, that &lt;em&gt;stuff accumulates.&lt;/em&gt; Wrapping mugs in towels, sitting on mattress toppers while taping boxes, and struggling with overweight suitcases. All the grocery bags I haven’t thrown go all at once, a bag in a bag in a bag as must be the natural order of things, a bag to contain another bag, a set another set, a life another life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the middle, that which contains everything important.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shreyas Balaji</name></author><summary type="html">It’s strangely universal—how come May, students all around feel relief mixed with an acute sensation of ending, like that of a season passed—and they think to themselves how the hell is the year already over.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using syntax highlighting for various languages is also a conceivably useful and cool feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
